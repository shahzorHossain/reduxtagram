// a reducer takes in two things:

// 1. the action (info about what happened)
// 2. copy of the current state

// a reducer handles the state changes from the actions

// all reducers will run for one action. We need to fix that by adding conditions

// comments will take care of the comment state
// post comments will take care of the indivitual comments
export function comments(state = [], action) {
  return state;
}
